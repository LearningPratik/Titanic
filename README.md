This is the first Machine learning model, where I tried to understand how EDA is performed and important features are identified.

How these features are fed into the machine learning model

I used Logistic as this was a classification problem

Did Visualization using Tableau, Link to that is below :

I will dive deep into how performance is measured and how we can improve our prediction in the next project.
